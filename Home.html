        <h2>Welcome to Pink Paws</h2>
        <h5><p>
            As well as being a volunteer organisation, Pink Paws is also a full-service Veterinary Clinic,<br> 
            and this forms an integral part of our organisation and the volunteer work we perform to improve Animal welfare in Cambodia.<br> 
            The fees we receive from our Veterinary work are one of the main sources of finance that we use to fund the many life-changing<br>
             projects we undertake not just for the benefit of the Animals, but also for the Cambodian people.<br>
             <br>

            By using our Veterinary Practice you are directly supporting Pink Paws improve the well being of the many<br>
            abandoned and stray cats and dogs specifically in Phnom Penh but also, in other parts of Cambodia where we have<br>
            partnerships and work to support those Animal rescue and Animal welfare organisations too.<br>

                neutered and in good health. If youâ€™re not able to adopt, but would like to help by fostering until a <br>
                new forever home can be found then we would love to hear from you too.</p></h5>
